This is a simple script to port forward the VNC and the SSH login port
to a remote machine, so that the remote host can perofrm maintenance on
the local machine.

The motivation here is to have a way to get connected to the machine
running vnc_tunnel from anywhere, when they might be behind firewalls
which block the VNC/login ports, or using a public network, where
traffic to those ports will not reach them.
